# Factorial

The factorial of any given positive integer n is n! = 1 · 2 · . . . · n. We can obtain it by starting with 1 and multiplying it by all the integers from 1 to n. Given some positive integer n, write the factorial of n and assign it to the variable factorial. 

Write a function:

## Solution(N)

For example, given N = 3 the function should return 6, because 3 factorial is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. Given N = 4 the function should return 24, because 4 factorial is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0, 1, 2.... 1024].
0 factorial is 1.
