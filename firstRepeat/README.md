# First Repeat

Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. 

Write a function

## solution(A);

such that it returns the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.

Examples:

Input:  arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 5 [5 is the first element that repeats]

Input:  arr[] = {6, 10, 5, 4, 9, 120, 4, 6, 10}
Output: 6 [6 is the first element that repeats]
