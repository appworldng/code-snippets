# Add Integer

An integer array represented thus A = [1, 2, 3, 4] can be added to one to yield an integer array thus A = [1, 2,3, 5].

Write a function:

## Solution(N)

that, given such an integer array as the above, it will yield an incremental value of 1 and thus display an array like so [1, 2, 3, 5]. For other cases such as [3, 7] should yield [3, 8] and [9, 9, 9] should yield [1, 0, 0, 0].
