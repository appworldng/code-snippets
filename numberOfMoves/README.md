# Number of Moves

Given an array that contains x & y coordinates, such as (x, y), find the different number of possible that a user can traverse to (x, y) starting from the origin, where each unit movement along the x-axis represents an R (right) and each unit movement along the y-axis represents an U (Up).

Write a function:

## Solution(N)

that gives the possible number of moves from the origin. 

For example, (1, 2) = 3 i.e. the different possible moves, the user can traverse to get to that coordinate from the origin as follows: RUU (RIGHT, UP, UP), URU (UP, RIGHT, UP), UUR (UP, UP, RIGHT).
